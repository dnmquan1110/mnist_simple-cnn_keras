# mnist_simple-cnn_keras
This is a final project of Machine Learning course. Our group choose to use CNN model to predict handwritten digit images. Model is implemented by Keras 

After training and evaluating model, we save this model to mnist_model.h5, and then deploy this model to streamlit app, which can predict the handwritten digit and output
the probability of 10 digits, and the final digit prediction output.

Link for streamlit app to test the model: https://share.streamlit.io/itlvd/mnist-detect-deploy-webapp/main/app.py
